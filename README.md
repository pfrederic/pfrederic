# 👋 Hey there, I'm Fred!

Welcome to my GitHub profile — make yourself at home! 🧑‍💻

## 🧠 About me

I'm a passionate software developer with **10+ years of experience**, mostly writing code that *actually works* (on a good day).  
I graduated from the **MIAGE Master's program** at Aix-Marseille University, where I learned how to mix business and IT like a pro 🧪💼.

Since then, I've been hopping between awesome companies, building stuff, breaking stuff (just a little), and learning a lot along the way.

## 💻 What I do

- 🛠️ Back-end development (mostly **Node.js**, with a dash of TypeScript)
- 🧬 APIs, GraphQL, AWS — you know, the usual suspects
- 🔍 Clean code, meaningful commits, and bad puns in PRs
- 📚 Always curious, always learning

## 🚀 Current Stack

- **Node.js** / **TypeScript**
- **GraphQL**
- **AWS**
- Past life in **React** (yes, I still remember `useEffect` nightmares)

## 🌍 When I'm not coding

You’ll probably find me:
- 🏃 Running marathons (literally)
- 🎵 Digging into rap albums
- 🛠️ Tinkering with new ideas
- 🧃 Drinking absurd amounts of coffee
